The handling for basic data can be seen in load_data.py:  
    including :  
        split train data into strat_train_set and strat_test_set.   
        Basic EDA  
        trial for handling data  

several models can be seen in models.py, but there are only models and are not so important  

The file first_way_predict.py is the first way used to make prediction, but can be enhanced to get a better performance(a little) in main_way.py.   

The file handling data, choosing model, tuning parameters and make predictions is named as main_way.py  
The answer predicted is named as ans_new.csv the second column is the answer(the probability of being 'yes')
